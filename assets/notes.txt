CSS Positioning

types: bottom only (same rules as right), top (left) not defined
	If bottom is defined and position is set to "relative"
		Bottom will be based of bottom of the original position of the object. 
	If bottom is defined and position is set to "absolute"
		Bottom value will be the based on the bottom of the first positioned ancestor 
	

Centered move 
	if 
		margin-left/right defined &&
		left + right ! defined &&
		position defined as relative 
			// position is based on margin values
			// Adjust margin left and right to keep relative offsets


	if 
		width ! defined &&
		left/right defined &&
		position is defined as absolute
			adjust left && right to keep width uniform on move. 

Centering:
relative with percentage;
absolute left right without width defined.
