## version 0.1.0 - Base Functionality
[ ] BoundingBox/Draw creation of new elements/components. Should pop up best guess for type of element. 
[ ] UI for background color, images and gradients
[ ] UI for border handling.
[ ] UI for fonts.
[ ] Project management UI. 
[ ] Auto Save of files.
[ ] Change history, undo/redo. 
[ ] Step based adjustment mode.
[ ] Pop-up focus on individual elements. 
[ ] Allow center, left, right alignment for groups of elements.
[ ] Allow multi selection
[ ] Allow distribution alignment.

## ISSUES
[ ] Element jumps when initially moved
[ ] Cursor alignment off in text editor
[ ] TEXT `data` chars end up messing up elements 
[ ] Elements disappear when moved outside th bounds of a component
[ ] UI boxes jump around when cursor hits certain regions
[ ] Setting Background color does not yield instance change in component.
[ ] Not all UI components load.  
[ ] Component and UI header too verbose. Need to use icons and menus to reduce their presence. 
[ ] Delete/Backspace in text edit does not update elements.
